Angular Applications.

	by using AngularJS We Can Create two types of Angular Applications.


1.Static Angular Application

2.Dynamic Angular Application


Static Angular Application.

	if View (Presentation Layer) (Recomended Tech : HTML5) not interacting with 

controller for dynamic data , then such type of Angular Application called as Static 

Angular Application.


Dynamic Angular Application.

	If View Interacting with the Controller , for Dynamic Data Then Such type of 

Angular Appliocation Called as Dynamic Angular Application.


Steps to Create the Static Angular Application.
-

Step 1.

	Create the Directory Structure for Angular Application (Folder Structure).

	
	*********************

Example_1 (folder)

	index.html

	*********************

	- Open the Folder Structure by using sublime text editor.



Step 2.

	Load the Angular Framework by using CDN.


index.html
-

<html>




	<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.0/angular.min.js"></script>
</html>


Step 3.

	Declare the "ng-app" directive.



<html ng-app>


</html>

1."ng-app" is a directive in AngularJS.

2.angular framework starts the execution from ng-app directive
  (angular.min.js)

3.ng-app directive takes the logical name of web application.

  - if our application is static , then logical name is the 
    
    optional

  - if our application is dynamic , then logical name of web 
    application mandatory.


4. we can't take more than one ng-app directive.



Step 4.

	
	Create the Models in Angular Application

index.html
-

<html ng-app>


	<input type="number" ng-model="model_one">

	<input type="number" ng-model="model_two">


	<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.0/angular.min.js"></script>
</html>



Step 5.

	Bind the Model Data to the HTML Elements

<h1 ng-bind="model_one+model_two"></h1>
