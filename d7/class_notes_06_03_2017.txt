Directives.

	- By using directives we can enhance the HTML Capabilities.

	- In AngularJS We Can Use the Directives in 3 ways.

	1.As an Element (HTML Element)

	2.As an Class   (CSS Class)

	3.As an Attribute  (HTML Attributes)


Ex.

	Directive  --         "my_directive"


<my_directive></my_directive>    // Element Usage

<h1 class="my_directive"></h1>   // CSS Class Usage

<h1 my_directive></h1>           // Attribute Usage


	- We Have Two Types of Directives.

		1.Predefined Directives


			The Directives Given By the Framework Called as Predefined Directives.



		2.Custom Directives

			
			The Directives Developed  By Developer Based on Application Requirement 

                        Called as Custom Directives




Predefined Directives.

	
1.ng-controller

	- This Directive used to declare the Controllers in View (HTML)

	Ex.

		ng-controller = "name of the Controller"

	
	- name of the controller is "user defined" name.

	Ex.

		ng-controller="my_controller"


	- As a Developer we can take more than one controller per web Application.

	Ex.

		<html>

				<div ng-controller="ctrl_one">

				</div>


				<div ng-controller="ctrl_two">


				</div>

		</html>

	- In Genaral we will implement Controllers in JavaScript.

	Ex.

		app.controller("ctrl_one" , ctrl_one); //arg1 - name of the controller.

						       //arg2 - function to implement the                                                                       controller.



		ctrl_one.$inject=["$scope"];


		function ctrl_one($scope){


			//Logic Goes Here


		}
